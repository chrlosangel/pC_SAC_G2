Keep only built-in functions:
    * reconstruct
    * submatrices - need to split into actuall submatrices and other utils
    * utils 
    * globals

Move all notebooks to a new directory
Keep an example for how to run main_functions and update it
Decide if utils and reconstruct are gonna be here or in main folder
